# Hotel Manager Tool
Manage your hotels or reservations in an easy way...

<h1>Building the project</h1>
The client can be compiled into a jar to later run it via Java while the server it's directly ran by maven.

To pack the client you can either run the `buildClient.bat` located in the root folder or type the  following command in the Client folder:

>mvn install -DskipTests

To run the project you can run the following command

>java -jar [Client]*/target/Client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies

To run the server, you can either run the `runServer.bat` or run the following command in the Server folder:

>mvn compile datanucleus:enhance exec:java -DskipTests

To run the JUnits found in each module of the project you can just run

>mvn test

and you'll find the corresponding result in `[Client/Server]*/target/jacoco.exec`


Or enter the target folder and double clicking the jar file (In the case of the Server it's not recommended as it does not have a GUI, if you want to kill the process afterwards you will have to kill the entire java proccess)

Create database schema
>mvn datanucleus:schema-create

Create database and give user permissions
>/* DELETE 'HotelManagementDB' database*/
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS HotelManagementDB;
/* DELETE USER 'spq' AT LOCAL SERVER*/
DROP USER IF EXISTS 'spq'@'localhost';
/* CREATE 'HotelManagementDB' DATABASE */
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS HotelManagementDB;
/* CREATE THE USER 'spq' AT LOCAL SERVER WITH PASSWORD 'spq' */
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'spq'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'spq';
/* GRANT FULL ACCESS TO THE DATABASE 'spq' FOR THE USER 'HotelManagementDB' AT LOCAL SERVER*/
GRANT ALL ON HotelManagementDB.* TO 'spq'@'localhost';



Delete and clean all the artifacts generated by previous builds
>mvn clean
