<h1>Building the project</h1>
To compile the project run the next command in the part you want to compile

> mvn install

To run the project you can either run the following command

>java -jar [Client/Server]*/target/[Client/Server]-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies

Or enter the target folder and double clicking the jar file (In the case of the Server it's not recommended as it does not have a GUI, if you want to kill the process afterwards you will have to kill the entire java proccess)
